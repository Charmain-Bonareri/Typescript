                   Javascript Operators

The assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable.
let x = 5;         // assign the value 5 to x
let y = 2;         // assign the value 2 to y
let z = x + y;     // assign the value 7 to z (5 + 2)



The assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable.
let x = 10;


The addition operator (+) adds numbers:
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x + y;

The multiplication operator (*) multiplies numbers.
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x * y;

The addition assignment operator (+=) adds a value to a variable.
let x = 10;
x += 5;


                   JavaScript String Operators
The + operator can also be used to add (concatenate) strings.

let text1 = "John";
let text2 = "Doe";
let text3 = text1 + " " + text2;

The result of text3 will be:
John Doe


The += assignment operator can also be used to add (concatenate) strings:
let text1 = "What a very ";
text1 += "nice day";

The result of text1 will be:
What a very nice day


Adding Strings and Numbers
Adding two numbers, will return the sum, but adding a number and a string will return a string:

Example
let x = 5 + 5;
let y = "5" + 5;
let z = "Hello" + 5;
The result of x, y, and z will be:

10
55
Hello5

If you add a number and a string, the result will be a string!
